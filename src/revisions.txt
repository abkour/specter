1. Matrix element access
Previously elements were access by directly getting a copy/reference of the element at some index.
Now elements are accessed by performing a row-column lookup, e.g mat33[1][2] instead of mat33[6].
Reason: Easy of development, reduction of avoidable, hard to trace index errors.
