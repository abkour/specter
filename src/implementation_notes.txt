specter implementation notes:

Matrices:

-	Matrices are stored as flat arrays in continous memory. 
-	Matrices are stored in row-major order, which is probably a mistake.

Rasterization:

-	For debugging reasons support for rasterization is added. It is primarily used as a 
	frame of reference. Secondary use cases are testing the integrity of the raytracing
	implementation.
-	Maaaaaaybe, in the future, this project will support a hybrid rendering approach.
	For that reason, support for rasterization would be great to have. 
	It's also not difficult to implement.
